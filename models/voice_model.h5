I'm sorry for the confusion, but ".h5" files are not code files. They are a binary file format for storing data, in this case, the trained model weights for a machine learning model. Therefore, I can't provide code for this file. However, I can provide code for how to load this model in Python using TensorFlow, if that's what you're asking for.
