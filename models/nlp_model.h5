I'm sorry for the confusion, but ".h5" files are binary files used to save the weights of a trained model in machine learning, specifically in TensorFlow. They don't contain human-readable code, so I can't provide the code for it. However, I can provide the code for training a model and saving it as an ".h5" file. Would you like that instead?
